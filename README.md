# Dress-Recommendation
A clothing recommendation API built with FastAPI and scikit-learn. This project uses a collaborative filtering approach to recommend similar clothing items based on user ratings. It's a great example of deploying a machine learning model as a RESTful API.


Clothing Recommendation API
An API that provides clothing recommendations based on user ratings using a collaborative filtering approach. This project uses FastAPI to serve the recommendations and scikit-learn's NearestNeighbors model to find similar items.

Features
Item-based Recommendations: Get a list of similar items for any given clothing item.

Fast and Efficient: Built with FastAPI for high-performance and asynchronous request handling.

Simple to Use: A single, clear POST endpoint to request recommendations.

Scalable: The model is loaded into memory on startup, making subsequent requests very fast.

Technologies Used
FastAPI: For building the web API.

pandas: For data manipulation and creating the user-item matrix.

scikit-learn: For the NearestNeighbors model used in collaborative filtering.

Uvicorn: An ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
